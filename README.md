commit 1: typically you sould not commit on master/main. We'll just do a test commit on master/main.
commit 2: is another commit on master/main.

branch 1/commit 1: is a branch off of master/main. Once created, you can commit to it. The head is now pointing to branch 1.
branch 1/commit 2: is another commit on branch 1.

Before making any changes to the code, you should create a branch. You should not commit to master/main. You should commit to the branch and then merge it back to master/main. This way you can keep master/main clean and stable. 

Now, let's make a change to the code after the recent merge. Before making any changes, I create a new branch2 off of master/main. 

Now, I make a change to the code on branch2.

I have jusst created a new branch 3 off of master/main.

This is a change to the code on branch3.
