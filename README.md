commit 1: typically you sould not commit on master/main. We'll just do a test commit on master/main.
commit 2: is another commit on master/main.

branch 1/commit 1: is a branch off of master/main. Once created, you can commit to it. The head is now pointing to branch 1.
branch 1/commit 2: is another commit on branch 1.

This is a test to o back 2 steps and check out branch 1 and make a commit on it.
